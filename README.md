# Shopping App
#### Shopping Cart application - Object Oriented Design Capstone Project
##### Ross Parsons, Matthew Taylor, Julian Justin-Djoum


The Shopping Cart application will allow customers to buy products being sold by sellers in the marketplace. The application will be used by both customers and sellers. Customers will be able to select products to view and purchase, while the sellers will be able to provide the products to sell to the customers. The application client will be built using the Java Swing library as a desktop application.
